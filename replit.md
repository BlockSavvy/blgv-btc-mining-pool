# BLGV BTC Mining Pool - Replit Configuration

## Overview

The BLGV BTC Mining Pool is an institutional-grade Bitcoin-only mining pool built with Python/Flask. It features Stratum V2 protocol support, multi-tier mining capabilities (centralized pool, P2Pool, and solo mining), and seamless integration with the broader BLGV BTC ecosystem including dex.blgvbtc.com. The application is designed to rival established pools like Ocean Pool and F2Pool while maintaining Bitcoin purity and superior user experience with matching UI/UX from the BLGV DEX.

## System Architecture

### Core Technology Stack
- **Mining Engine**: Rust Stratum V2 core for high-performance share validation and job distribution
- **API Layer**: Python/Flask for web interface, statistics, and ecosystem integration
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for share tracking, reward calculations, and miner management
- **Caching**: Redis for high-speed communication between Rust core and Python API
- **Mining Protocol**: True Stratum V2 with WebSocket support on port 3333
- **Frontend**: React.js with Tailwind CSS matching BLGV DEX design

### Architecture Components
- **Stratum Server**: Handles miner connections and job distribution
- **API Server**: RESTful and WebSocket APIs for pool statistics and management
- **Database Layer**: PostgreSQL with SQLx for type-safe database operations
- **Bitcoin Integration**: RPC client for Bitcoin Core/Knots node communication
- **Payment Processing**: BTCPay Server integration for Lightning and on-chain payouts
- **Communication**: Nostr protocol integration for decentralized notifications

## Key Components

### Mining Infrastructure
- **Stratum V2 Protocol**: Modern mining protocol with job negotiation and enhanced security
- **Multi-Algorithm Support**: SHA-256 Bitcoin-only mining with ASIC and Bitaxe compatibility
- **Reward Systems**: 
  - PPS+ (Pay Per Share Plus) for stable payouts
  - PPLNS (Pay Per Last N Shares) for loyalty rewards
- **Hardware Auto-Configuration**: Automatic setup for Antminer, Whatsminer, and Bitaxe devices

### Security Features
- **Multi-Signature Wallets**: 99% cold storage with enterprise-grade security
- **TLS Encryption**: All Stratum connections encrypted
- **DDoS Protection**: Cloudflare integration planned
- **Authentication**: Support for wallet signatures and 2FA

### Integration Capabilities
- **BLGV Ecosystem**: Integration with dex.blgvbtc.com and blgvbtc.com
- **UI/UX Consistency**: Matching design language and styling from BLGV DEX
- **Payment Rails**: Lightning Network and on-chain Bitcoin payments
- **Communication**: Nostr relay for decentralized notifications
- **Analytics**: Real-time hash rate monitoring and profitability calculations

## Data Flow

### Mining Process
1. Miners connect via Stratum V2 protocol to port 3333
2. Pool distributes work templates and receives share submissions
3. Shares are validated and stored in PostgreSQL database
4. Reward calculations performed using PPS+ or PPLNS algorithms
5. Payouts processed through BTCPay Server integration

### Real-Time Updates
1. WebSocket connections provide live pool statistics
2. Dashboard updates every 30 seconds with latest metrics
3. Nostr relay broadcasts notifications for major events
4. API endpoints serve current pool state and historical data

### Data Storage
- **PostgreSQL**: Miners, shares, blocks, payouts, and pool statistics
- **Redis**: Session management, temporary data, and caching layer
- **File System**: Static assets, configuration files, and logs

## External Dependencies

### Core Services
